# docker-swarm-config

There are a number of systems in the home configuration:
- Synology DS1511+ with DSM 6.2.1 + docker, (4 core 4GB)
- Mac Mini with (10,1) ESXi 6.5 (4 core, 8 vCPU and 16GB)

On the Mac Mini there are two Ubuntu VMs running with docker.

First project is to run an openflixr (http://www.openflixr.com) kind of system in the Docker Swarm. Goal is to have scalable plex docker containers and to use the standard images that have been build by others.
